# Experimentation Platform Engineer Take-Home Assessment



## Overview

Build a simplified experimentation API that demonstrates your ability to work with the core technologies and concepts in our stack. You may use AI tools to assist with implementation.



## The Challenge

Create a basic A/B testing API service that allows:

- Creating experiments with multiple variants

- Assigning users to experiment variants

- Recording experiment events/conversions

- Retrieving experiment performance data



## Technical Requirements



### API Endpoints

Build a Python REST API with these endpoints:



**POST /experiments** - Create a new experiment



**GET /experiments/{id}/assignment/{user_id}** - Get user's variant assignment

- Must be idempotent: once a user receives a variant assignment for an experiment, all subsequent calls must return the same assignment

- Assignments should be stored persistently

- Assignment logic should support configurable traffic allocation percentages per variant



**POST /events** - Record events

- Events must include at minimum: user_id, type (e.g., "click", "purchase", "signup"), timestamp, and properties (flexible JSON object for additional context)



**GET /experiments/{id}/results** - Get experiment performance summary

- Only count events that occur AFTER a user's assignment timestamp

- Design a flexible reporting structure that supports various types of analysis

- Consider what query parameters would enable different views of the data (e.g., time ranges, event types, aggregation levels)

- Think creatively about how to structure the response to support different use cases (real-time monitoring, deep analysis, executive summaries, etc.)

- Your design should demonstrate understanding of what stakeholders need from experiment results



### Authentication

- All endpoints must be protected with Bearer token authentication

- Validate tokens against an internal list (can be configuration-based or in-memory)

- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for authentication failures



### Data Layer

- Use any database you prefer (SQLite is fine for simplicity)

- Design a schema that supports experiments, variants, user assignments, and events

- Consider appropriate indexes for common query patterns



### Infrastructure

- Provide a simple deployment configuration (Docker, docker-compose, or basic AWS CDK)

- Include basic environment configuration and dependency management



## Deliverables



1. **Working code with clear setup instructions**

   - All source code

   - README with setup and running instructions

   - Requirements/dependencies file



2. **Brief documentation (15-20 minutes)**

   - Architecture decisions and trade-offs

   - How you'd extend this for production scale

   - One improvement you'd prioritize next

   - Explanation of your results endpoint design philosophy and choices



3. **Example usage**

   - Simple script or curl commands demonstrating all API endpoints

   - Include examples showing idempotent assignment behavior



## Evaluation Criteria

- **Code quality**: Clean, readable Python with appropriate error handling

- **API design**: RESTful principles and practical usability

- **Data modeling**: Logical schema design and query efficiency

- **Problem-solving**: How you handle edge cases and constraints

- **Communication**: Clear documentation of decisions and trade-offs

- **Number of additional features implemented**



## Additional Features (Optional)

- Basic feature flagging capability

- Simple caching strategy

- Unit tests for critical paths

- Creative metrics or analysis features in the results endpoint
